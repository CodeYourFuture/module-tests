## What's here?

Some formative questions on the topic of playing computer - variable assignment, flow control through if/else, and function calls.

These are not yet in a final form to present to students (the mentor notes are spoilers to students).


## How to use these

These should be done in isolation, then group, with complete predictions always being concretely made (written down and shared) before each reveal.

Don't give the students an interpreter when doing these.

## Note: 

Don't present these files to students in their current form!  The "What's being assessed" sections are intended only for mentors to see, for example.


## TODO: 
build into kahoot or more presentable (but non-runnable) form.
