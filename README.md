# JavaScript Modules 1 & 2 Exercises

These exercises will allow us - and also yourself - to evaluate your current knowledge about JavaScript programming.

Your code will be reviewed and you will receive a feedback from a mentor about what you've done well and where you can improve.

Please do complete the questions on your own and do not slack/chat with your colleagues.

You may not use Google or StackOverFlow to find solutions and always try to do it yourself first
We suggest you to only use the Javascript documentation from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
2.  Please provide implementation for each function - fill in the parts marked with `TODO:`
3.  Tests marked with `xit` are ignored, so in order to run a test, you need to change the `module1.test.js` file from...

```
  xit("Q? - Description", function() { ...
```

to

```
  it("Q? - Description", function() { ...
```

4.  Make sure you use git to push your code to GitHub when you have successfully tested your solution to each question.
5.  When you have completed the questions, make a pull request back to the CYF repository.

## Goals

- Read carefully all the code, all comments as well as the unit tests to understand what the code is supposed to do
- Fill in the parts marked with TODO
- Make all the tests pass! :)

**Bonus:** if you're done before the end of the allotted time, you can try to modify your code to use the [ES6 syntax](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/).

## Install

Fork and clone this repository to your computer and install the packages with `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codeyourfuture/module-tests.git

cd module-tests

npm install
```

## Run the unit tests

You can run the following command to run the unit tests:

```sh
npm test
```

To run and watch:

```sh
npm test -- --watch
```

## Submit your solution

Don't forget to commit your code often. Once it's ready, create a pull request with your solution.

Commits done after the time is up won't be considered...
