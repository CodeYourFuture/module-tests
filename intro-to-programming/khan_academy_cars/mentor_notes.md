# Teaching Notes - Khan Academy cars exercise

## Time: 10 mins

## What's being assessed here?

Core task:

* Code reading: student is able to explain which each section of the code generally does
* Code reading: student is able to explain what each line of the code does
* Pattern recognition: student recognises code that could be repeatable/abstracted
* Choosing the right tool: student knows that a function is useful for abstraction
* Correct application of repetition: student shows three cars, even if they aren't in the correct positions
* Playing computer: if the cars are drawn on top of each other, the student thinks through the problem and is able to explain why
* Correct application of a function: student can correctly write a function to draw the car
* Correct application of parameters: student uses a parameter to draw the car at different positions
* Communication during task

Advanced task 1:

* Choosing the right tool: student knows to draw the cars within the `draw` function
* Correct application of assignment: student updates the `x` variable within the `draw` function
* Problem solving/exploration: how well does the student deal with a problem? The student is likely to run into an issue (with the background not being reset on each animation frame). How do they cope with solving this issue? Are they able to explain why the problem exists?

Advanced task 2: 

* Playing computer: student thinks through the sequence of necessary steps to add a conditional
* Correct application of a conditional: student is able to correctly use a conditional, even if the car doesn't "bounce" in the correct position

## Presenting the task

TODO: Remind the student to explain their thought process while doing the task? Does this add to much cognitive load? Too high an intimidation factor?

## TODO: rubric

??? I don't have experience making these...

## Suggested hints

Core task:

* "Great! Can you do this in a way that uses fewer lines of code?"
* "It looks like we want to do the same thing but in different places"
* "The cars are being drawn on top of each other, how could we change that?"

Advanced task 1:

* If they're struggling with starting the animation: "Could we look at the documentation?" (see tab below editor, Environment section)
* "I think we're re-drawing the cars, but their position isn't changing. How could we fix that?"
* If they are stuck with the "smearing cars" problem: "Could we talk through each step of the animation? I think we're missing a step"

Advanced task 2:

* "How could we control the speed of the cars?"
* "If we have negative speed, what happens to the car?"
